This Git repository contains several components related to stock market analysis and machine learning (ML) / deep learning (DL) models. The main components are an article.pdf file presenting researched data, a simulator directory for generating datasets, and a models directory containing ML and DL models. This README provides an overview of the repository structure and instructions for using the components.

Components
article.pdf: This file contains a detailed research article discussing various aspects of stock market data, including trends, volatility, and other metrics. It presents analyzed data and findings in a structured format for reference and further study.

simulator directory: This directory contains the code for a simulator tool that generates datasets related to stock changes and various metrics. The simulator is designed to create realistic market scenarios for research, testing, or educational purposes.

models directory: This directory includes ML and DL models related to stock market analysis. These models can be used for predictive modeling, forecasting, or other tasks based on the datasets generated by the simulator or real-world data.

Instructions
Accessing the Research Article
The article.pdf file can be accessed directly from the repository. You can download or view it using your preferred PDF viewer software.

Using the Simulator
To use the simulator tool in the simulator directory, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Navigate to the simulator directory:

bash
Copy code
cd simulator
Install any dependencies required by the simulator. Check the README.md file inside the simulator directory for specific instructions on dependencies and setup.

Run the simulator code to generate datasets. Depending on the simulator's functionality, you may need to provide input parameters or configure settings before running.

Once the simulator completes its execution, you should find the generated datasets in a specified output directory or as per the simulator's output instructions.

Using the ML/DL Models
The models directory contains pre-trained ML and DL models for stock market analysis. Follow these steps to utilize the models:

Navigate to the models directory:

bash
Copy code
cd models
Choose the appropriate model based on your requirements and data.

Follow the instructions provided in the model's README file for usage, including loading the model, preprocessing input data, and making predictions or analyses.
