# Git Repository Readme

This Git repository contains several components related to stock market analysis and machine learning (ML) / deep learning (DL) models. The main components are an `article.pdf` file presenting researched data, a `simulator` directory for generating datasets, and a `models` directory containing ML and DL models. This README provides an overview of the repository structure and instructions for using the components.

## Components

1. `article.pdf`: This file contains a detailed research article discussing various aspects of stock market data, including trends, volatility, and other metrics. It presents analyzed data and findings in a structured format for reference and further study.

2. `simulator` directory: This directory contains the code for a simulator tool that generates datasets related to stock changes and various metrics. The simulator is designed to create realistic market scenarios for research, testing, or educational purposes.

3. `models` directory: This directory includes ML and DL models related to stock market analysis. These models can be used for predictive modeling, forecasting, or other tasks based on the datasets generated by the simulator or real-world data.

## Instructions

### Accessing the Research Article

The `article.pdf` file can be accessed directly from the repository. You can download or view it using your preferred PDF viewer software.

### Using the Simulator

To use the simulator tool in the `simulator` directory, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
